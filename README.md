# AI-Enabled Crime Pattern Prediction Dashboard

# Overview

This project is a web-based dashboard that uses Indian crime datasets (2020â€“2024) to analyze and visualize crime patterns, hotspots, and trends. The system applies machine learning (clustering & classification) and geospatial mapping to help identify high-risk zones and provide community safety insights.
